# Municipal Services Application - Part 1

This repository contains Part 1 of my final year project for the PROG7312 module. The goal is to develop a proof-of-concept ASP.NET Core MVC application designed to streamline municipal service reporting within a South African context. This first part establishes the core application structure and implements the "Report an Issue" feature.

## Key Features Implemented (Part 1)

* **Professional User Interface:** A modern, responsive, multi-section landing page and a well-structured form page, designed with inspiration from official government websites.
* **Issue Reporting Functionality:** A fully functional issue reporting form with server-side validation. Users can provide a location, select a category, write a description, and attach media.
* **Custom Data Structure:** All submitted issue reports are stored in memory using a custom-built generic Linked List, adhering to the project's core technical constraints.
* **User Engagement Strategy:** The "Community-Verified Reporting with Trusted Contributor Badges" strategy is seamlessly integrated into the UI to encourage user participation, as per the research component of the project.

## Core Technical Requirements & Constraints

A primary requirement of this project is to demonstrate a strong understanding of fundamental data structures. As such, no built-in .NET collections like `List<T>` or arrays have been used for data storage. All user-submitted data is managed by a custom-built generic `CustomLinkedList<T>` class.

The application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns between the data, logic, and presentation layers.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** C#, .NET 8, ASP.NET Core MVC
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
* **Icons:** Font Awesome
