# Municipal Services Application - Parts 1 & 2

This repository contains my submission for Parts 1 and 2 of the final year project for the PROG7312 module. The project is an ASP.NET Core MVC application designed to be a comprehensive portal for municipal service reporting and community engagement, specifically tailored for the City of Cape Town.

## Part 1: Issue Reporting

Part 1 established the core application and the "Report an Issue" feature.

### Key Features:

* **Professional UI:** A modern, responsive landing page and a structured, user-friendly form page.
* **Functional Reporting Form:** Allows users to submit detailed issue reports with location, category, description, and optional media attachments.
* **Custom Linked List:** All submitted reports are stored in memory using a custom-built generic `CustomLinkedList<T>`, adhering to project constraints.
* **User Engagement Strategy:** The "Community-Verified Reporting with Trusted Contributor Badges" strategy is explained and integrated directly into the reporting workflow.

## Part 2: Local Events & Recommendation Engine

Part 2 expands the application's functionality by introducing a dynamic "Local Events & Announcements" page with advanced features.

### Key Features:

* **Event Display & Seeding:** The application starts by seeding 15+ sample events into the system. These are displayed on a professional, card-based UI.
* **Search, Filter & Sort:** The events page includes a full suite of tools allowing users to:
    * üîç **Search** for events by title.
    * üìÇ **Filter** events by category.
    * ‚ÜïÔ∏è **Sort** events by date or title.
* **Smart Recommendation Engine:** A recommendation algorithm was developed to enhance user experience. It works by:
    1.  **Tracking** the categories a user filters by.
    2.  **Analyzing** this history to determine their most frequent preference.
    3.  **Suggesting** other relevant events from that category in a "Recommended for You" section.
* **Advanced Custom Data Structures:** This part's functionality is powered by several custom-built data structures:
    * **`CustomSortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`:** Used as the primary storage for events, keeping them sorted chronologically by date.
    * **`CustomSet<T>`:** Used to efficiently manage the unique list of event categories for the filter dropdown.
    * **`CustomPriorityQueue<T>`:** Used to manage and prioritize "featured" or important events.

## How to Use the Application

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the application's features as of the Part 2 submission.

### 1. The Landing Page

The application opens on the main landing page, which serves as the central hub. From here, you can:
* Get a high-level overview of the portal's purpose.
* Use the primary "Report an Issue Now" button in the hero section to navigate directly to the reporting form.
* Use the navigation cards or the top navigation bar to access different sections of the application.

### 2. Reporting an Issue (Part 1 Feature)

1.  Click on the **"Report an Issue"** or **"Go to Form"** button.
2.  On the reporting page, fill out the required fields: Location, Category, and a detailed Description.
3.  You can optionally attach a photo or video using the "Choose File" button.
4.  Click **"Submit Issue"**. A success message will appear at the top of the form. The "Your Impact" section on the right explains the next steps and the badge system.

### 3. Viewing and Interacting with Local Events (Part 2 Feature)

1.  From the homepage or the top navigation bar, click on **"Local Events"**.
2.  The page will load, displaying a full list of all sample events, sorted by the newest date first.
3.  You can use the interactive bar at the top to:
    * **Search:** Type into the "Search by event title..." box to find specific events.
    * **Filter:** Use the "All Categories" dropdown to view events from only one category.
    * **Sort:** Use the "Sort by" dropdown to organize events by newest/oldest date or by title (A-Z / Z-A).

### 4. Triggering the Smart Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine is a key feature of Part 2 and requires user interaction to work.
1.  On the "Local Events" page, use the **category filter dropdown** to search for a specific category (e.g., "Civic Duty") and click "Search".
2.  The page will reload with the filtered results.
3.  **Repeat this process** a few times, searching for the same category or different ones.
4.  After a few searches, the system will identify your most frequent preference. A new **"Recommended For You"** section will automatically appear, suggesting other events from your favorite category.

## Code References & Explanations

This section provides a brief overview of the key technical implementations and architectural patterns used in this project.

### Custom Generic Data Structures

To adhere to the project's core requirement of not using built-in .NET collections, all data structures were implemented from scratch. The use of **generics** (`<T>`) makes these structures type-safe and reusable.

* **`CustomLinkedList<T>`:** The foundational structure used as the internal backing for all other collections.
* **`CustomSet<T>`:** Enforces uniqueness, used to manage the list of event categories for the filter dropdown.
* **`CustomSortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`:** Maintains a collection of key-value pairs sorted by the key. This is used as the primary storage for events, keeping them organized chronologically.
* **`CustomPriorityQueue<T>`:** A queue that orders items based on a priority value, used here to manage "featured" events.

### ASP.NET Core MVC Architecture

The project is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

* **Model (`.cs` files in `/Models`):** Defines the C# objects for our data (e.g., `IssueReport`, `Event`). Data annotations (`[Required]`) are used for server-side validation.
* **View (`.cshtml` files in `/Views`):** Uses Razor syntax to render the HTML user interface based on data from the controller. A `_Layout.cshtml` file provides a consistent template for all pages.
* **Controller (`HomeController.cs`):** Handles HTTP requests, processes form data, interacts with the data stores, and selects the appropriate view to return to the user.

### In-Memory State Management

With no database requirement, the application's state is managed in-memory via a `static GlobalData` class. This class holds a single, static instance of each data structure, ensuring data persists for the application's lifecycle and is accessible from any part of the application.
